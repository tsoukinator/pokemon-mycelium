  # Pokemon with a level equal or greather to 1 (Which usually it's the minimum) have their 1st innate unlocked
  # Pokemon with a level equal or greather to 15 have their 1st and 2nd innate unlocked
  # Pokemon with a level equal or greather to 50 have all of their innates unlocked
  # Locked abilities are displayed as "Locked" in the summary if using the summary add-on
  # Pokemon can be of a lower level than the first value, they will simply not have an Innate available.
  # You can add specific cases for a pokemon in the array by inputting it's ID first, then the 3 levels required to unlock it's proper innate.
  # For example, using "[:MEWTWO, 45, 70, 90]," before the "nameless" array, will make that Mewtwo and ALL OF IT'S FORMS have their Innates 
  # to be unloked at level 45, 70 and 90. You can use as many of these special cases as you want. You can use this to make let pokemon unlock their innates
  # sooner or later than the rest.
  # LEVELS_TO_UNLOCK =  [
  # [:MEWTWO, 45, 70, 90],
  # [:ARCEUS, 80, 90, 100],

  #And use those X innates to be the active innates a pokemon has. 
  #The amount can be defined with the INNATE_MAX_AMOUNT setting.
  #Keep in mind, having this setting off will simply load ALL of the innates defined in each pokemon's "Innates =" section of the PBS.
